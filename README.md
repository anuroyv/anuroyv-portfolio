# Telling Stories with Data | Final Group Project | Part II
## Initial Storyboards
The initial storyboards were created after completing a primilinary analysis on ArcGIS to get an understanding of the dataset being analysed. The project would use GIS to create choropleth maps of U.S. counties; and Tableau to visualize trendlines of prices and income. Further to refine the dataviz, Adobe InDeisgn would be used. The mode of presentation would be based on Esri Story Maps.
## User Research Protocol
The intended audience for this project is general population and millenials specifically. People who have faced affordability issues when they ever thought of buying homes. A segment of the pupolation could also be casual analysts looking for price-income trends of specific cities under consideration. For feedback purposes, three Carnegie Mellon Students were chosen from diverse backgrounds and fields of interests. Their feedback was used to make alterations in the design of the story and make it more informed. The feedback was incorporated in the design of the visuals along with the methodology of story telling.
