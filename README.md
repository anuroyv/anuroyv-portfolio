This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data class at CMU!

# About me
Hey! I am Anuroy, a second year grad student at Carnegie Mellon University. I am from MS-AECM program. I have a background in architecture and design. Currently, I am developing my expertise in real estate and financial analysis. I plan on working in the construction/real estate industry after I graduate. 

# What I hope to learn
I believe that my reports and analyses lack an aesthetic in general, I am also very interested in presenting my data in a more appealing way to its audience. Apart from all this, I wish to develop a strong foundation for some of the data analytic tools that will be taught in class.
