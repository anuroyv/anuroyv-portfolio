# Telling Stories with Data | Final Group Project | Part II
## Initial Storyboards
The initial storyboards were created after completing a primilinary analysis on ArcGIS to get an understanding of the dataset being analysed. The project would use GIS to create choropleth maps of U.S. counties; and Tableau to visualize trendlines of prices and income. Further to refine the dataviz, Adobe InDeisgn would be used. The mode of presentation would be based on Esri Story Maps.

#### This Slide gives the users an understanding of what the project is about and its problem statement.

The slide shows the housing trends and pricing forecasts for year 2024. The slider in the middle helps the user navigate both maps simultaneously.
![slide_3](slide_3.jpg)
The slide shows the areas when housing prices are high and might have affordability issues. These are the selected areas, where further reasearch would be conducted. 
![slide_4](slide_4.jpg)
These are the price-income trendlines for the chosen cities. These trendlines would demonstrate the "gap" and affordability issues. 
## User Research Protocol
The intended audience for this project is general population and millenials specifically. People who have faced affordability issues when they ever thought of buying homes. A segment of the pupolation could also be casual analysts looking for price-income trends of specific cities under consideration. For feedback purposes, three Carnegie Mellon Students were chosen from diverse backgrounds and fields of interests. Their feedback was used to make alterations in the design of the story and make it more informed. The feedback was incorporated in the design of the visuals along with the methodology of story telling. 
### Question 1: What do you understand by the Storyboards?
#### Answer 1: The gap in income of people versus the price of houses in the market currently.
#### Answer 2: How real estate has become less affordable in recent years.
#### Answer 3: Which cities have the most expensive housing in general. 
### Question 2: How easy it is for you to understand the data being analysed?
#### Answer 1: Easy, good methodology of visualization.
#### Answer 2: Simple yet effective.
#### Answer 3: (Was visibly disoriented by choropleth map) Fair.
### Question 3: What do you think is the aim of this project?
#### Answer 1: To show how some cities have affordability issues in terms of housing. 
#### Answer 2: To show how income is not matching to prices of real estate commodities.
#### Answer 3: What areas are plagued by affordable housing issues.
### Question 4: Do you like the aesthetic of these visuals?
#### Answer 1: Yes. Less colors more meaning. The image intended to be used for title slide should be more minimal.
#### Answer 2: More contrast should be used to show stark contrast in price and income.
#### Answer 3: Yes, everything looks clear except for the 2nd storyboard.
### Question 5: What does the story lack?
#### Answer 1: A more personal feel.
#### Answer 2: How does it affect me or my generation.
#### Answer 3: (Stayed fixated on 2nd storyboard). 
### Question 6: Do you believe this research and visauls are authentic and reliable?
#### Answer 1: Yes
#### Answer 2: Yes
#### Answer 3: Yes
### Question 7: What would you add to this story?
#### Answer 1: More visuals to make the story even more clear.
#### Answer 2: Nothing it looks perfect.
#### Answer 3: Maps of cities under consideration. 

## Revised Wireframes
Based on the feedback, it was decide that the image on the title slide would be changed to keep it more minimal and informative. It was further decided that to better visualize the impact of affordability, a simple yet effective visualization would be added to the project. The aim of this graphic would be to show how this issue affects, our generation in general. The feedback also suggested that a brief discriptive explaination of data should be added to the slides for better understanding. 
The aim of the final project would be to:
#### Keep the color palette constant and color changes to a miminum.
#### Keep the visuals simple and comprehensible.
#### Add a brief discription of the data.
#### Keeping the overall aesthetic homogeneous across all the slides.
#### A more simple yet discriptive Title of the project should be thought of.
