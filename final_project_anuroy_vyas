# Telling Stories with Data | Final Group Project | Part 1

# Project Outline
Housing Affordability Issue: 
This project will aim to show how increasing disparity between income and housing prices have made it extremely difficult for people to buy homes. The difference (in affordability) will be shown by comparing median household prices and median household income over the years. 
These trendlines will accurately showcase how it has become impossible for almost all millennials to own homes. 
The story arc:
Housing prices in the major cities of US have been increasing by a drastic pace for a long time now. Unfortunately for people, their income level has not kept up with this steep increasing. 
As a direct result, buying real estate for investment or living purposes has become extremely difficult for most. This trend is relatively new and affects the current working population the most. 
One example of a matrix used to accurately gauge the relationship of housing prices and income levels is price-income ratio. Where price of a house over income is calculated and used for the basis of analysis. 
However, this matric alone doesnâ€™t accurately show visually how dire the situation actually is. 
There is major gap between median household income and median household prices in all parts of the country and this gap should be used to visualize the data present.
The final aim of this analysis to inform its audience about this detrimental trend, how it affects them, and ineffectiveness of policy decisions taken by authorities pertaining to affordability of houses.

# DATA
The source of data used for this project would be Zillow. Zillow is a private organization which collects, organizes and analyses real estate trends in United States. 
They collaborate officially with Tableau and ESRI to organize data viz competitions and conferences like Iron Viz annually. The project will use a lot of Zillow specific terminology to make the users understand the data they are looking at. 
Important Zillow Terminology: https://www.zillow.com/info/whats-the-zillow-home-value-index/ , https://wp.zillowstatic.com/3/ZHVI-InfoSheet-04ed2b.pdf
Core data used: https://www.zillow.com/research/data/ Note: TO download the data go to home values, ZHVI All Homes and choose Metro and U.S.
This data provides City names with their respective Zillow Home Index Values since year 1996 for every month. 
Median Household Income Data: https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=6db428407492470b8db45edaa0de44c1 , ESRI provides data on an early basis, this would be used to calculate the median household income. 

# Method and Medium
1. The data for ESRI would be used to create a map of U.S. (Using ArcGIS) to understand the cities which have experienced the highest growth over the past 20 years. This data would be visualized using a choropleth map as shown in the sketches.
2. Five cities would be shortlisted based on this analysis as key cities for further examination. 
3. Data from Zillow would be used to understand the pricing trends for real estate pertaining to these cities. 
4. Median Household Income for these cities would be extracted (Y-1996 to Y-2019).
5. Tableau would be used to visualize the data and create a dashboard which tells the entire story n the most concise manner. 
6. As a last part of the project Shorthand would be used to present the story in the most effective way by adding more compelling visuals and images to add to the value of the analysis. 
Overall, the project would use a combination of ArcGIS and Tableau for its analysis purposes, i.e. to compute means, medians, aggregations and trend analysis. They will also be used for visualization purposes and Tableau would be speciifcally be used for creating a dashboard. 
Later, for storytelling purposes Shorthand would be used.
